# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Wednesday 22nd March 2023

**Today's Progress**: Created a repository, found some projects, and tweeted my intentions to the world..

**Thoughts:** I've identified some courses and ideas. Here's my (very ambitious) tasklist:
FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum
Harvard's CS50x (via edX)
The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript course
[programming-23.mooc.fi](https://programming-23.mooc.fi)
6 projects I found on Github
5 personal coding projects, including a neighbourhood skillshare website
