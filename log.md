# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Wednesday 22nd March 2023

**Today's Progress**: Created a repository, found some projects, and tweeted my intentions to the world..

**Thoughts:** I've identified some courses and ideas. Here's my (very ambitious) tasklist:
- FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum
- Harvard's CS50x (via edX)
- The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript course
- [programming-23.mooc.fi](https://programming-23.mooc.fi)
- 6 projects I found on Github
- 5 personal coding projects, including a neighbourhood skillshare website

### Day 1: Thursday 23rd March 2023

**Today's Progress**: Tweeted my commitment to the project. Built a survey form with HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** I was almost too busy setting up this project to actually begin it.
I built a survey form with HTML and CSS: the first certification project for FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum.

### Day 2: Friday 24th March 2023

**Today's Progress**: University of Helsinki's Python Programming MOOC 2023 - Part 1 - Sections 1-3.

**Thoughts:** This is going to become a messy log, and I'll need to fix that.
Later.
Today I had a lot on at work and I've had time to complete the opening 3 sections of this MOOC.
There's no easily shareable link to my work on the MOOC - but I'll add anything cool I create from it here.
