# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Wednesday 22nd March 2023

**Today's Progress**: Created a repository, found some projects, and tweeted my intentions to the world..

**Thoughts:** I've identified some courses and ideas. Here's my (very ambitious) tasklist:
- FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum
- Harvard's CS50x (via edX)
- The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript course
- [programming-23.mooc.fi](https://programming-23.mooc.fi)
- 6 projects I found on Github
- 5 personal coding projects, including a neighbourhood skillshare website

### Day 1: Thursday 23rd March 2023

**Today's Progress**: Tweeted my commitment to the project. Built a survey form with HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** I was almost too busy setting up this project to actually begin it.
I built a survey form with HTML and CSS: the first certification project for FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum.

### Day 2: Friday 24th March 2023

**Today's Progress**: University of Helsinki's Python Programming MOOC 2023 - Part 1 - Sections 1-3.

**Thoughts:** This is going to become a messy log, and I'll need to fix that.
Later.
Today I had a lot on at work and I've had time to complete the opening 3 sections of this MOOC.
There's no easily shareable link to my work on the MOOC - but I'll add anything cool I create from it here.

### Day 3: Saturday 25th March 2023

**Today's Progress**: University of Helsinki's Python Programming MOOC 2023 - Part 1 - Sections 4-5.

**Thoughts:** Completed Part 1/7 of the Introduction to Programming section.

### Day 4: Sunday 26th March 2023

**Today's Progress**: University of Helsinki's Python Programming MOOC 2023 - Part 2 - Sections 1-2.

**Thoughts:** ... making slow progress at the start. Looking forward to getting more stuck in soon!

### Day 5: Tuesday 28th March 2023

**Today's Progress**: Created a 'Rothko painting' using CSS via FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** You're allowed one skip day, right? So long as it's no more than one in a row? Busy yesterday.

### Day 6: Thursday 30th March 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed penultimate bootcamp task, including a coding challenge.

**Thoughts:** I may have skipped two days this week. Busy with work and life. But, almost there with my bootcamp.
Today I almost finished the 'coding employability' tasks, including writing functions for an Exercism challenge.

### Day 5: Friday 31st March 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed my final bootcamp task! ðŸ¥³

**Thoughts:** Today and yesterday I've focused on finishing the 'build your brand' tasks I'd left until last.
I've now 100% completed all compulsory and optional tasks on the HyperionDev software engineering bootcamp.
My average grade was 100%, and I've practiced using Python, HTML, CSS, SQL and Django.
I'm not sure exactly what this means, but I ranked 16th out of 882 students on the programme.
Looking forward to earning some more certificates and learning some cool things.
